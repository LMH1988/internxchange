# 🌐 InternXchange  
**Peer-to-peer experience exchange for early tech talent**

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Breaking into tech shouldn’t feel like a locked door.

As someone who returned to learning later in life, juggled parenting and studies, and tried to launch into the tech world — I saw the same barriers again and again:

- Entry-level jobs asking for years of experience.
- Unpaid internships being one of the only ways in (despite being illegal in many places).
- Talented students and grads being reduced to a CV that doesn’t show half of who they are.

**I didn’t just want to talk about it — I wanted to build something that shows what’s possible.**

---

## 💡 What is InternXchange?

**InternXchange** is a small web app built to spark a bigger idea:

> A space where early talent can **share what they know**, **ask for what they need**, and **connect with peers to grow — together.**

This isn’t a job board. It’s a bridge.

---

## 🔧 What It Does

- 📝 Lets users add what they can **offer** and what they want to **learn**
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Displays a **live skill swap board** so peers can find each other
- 🔍 (Coming soon) Search and filter functionality to find relevant swaps
- 🧭 (Future goal) Matching students/grads with **employers who care about more than a CV**

---

## 💬 Who It's For

- 🎓 Students & grads struggling to get that “first break”
- 💼 Employers who want fresh, diverse talent — but need help connecting
- 🌍 Anyone who believes in fairer, more human routes into tech

---

## 💥 Why It Matters

This is more than a coding project — it’s a **statement**.

A proof-of-concept to show:
- What happens when people build *with* others in mind
- That talent doesn’t always look like a polished CV
- That sometimes, the best way to get experience is to create it

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

## 🚧 Still to Come

- Tagging + filtering
- Profile cards with richer info
- Save/share swap entries
- Employer view and intern matchmaking

---

## ❤️ Get Involved

Whether you're early in your career, an employer, or just someone who believes in doing things differently — I’d love feedback, ideas, and collaborators.

Let’s build the bridge instead of waiting for the gate to open.
