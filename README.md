# InternXchange  
**Peer-to-peer experience exchange for early tech talent**

## Why This Exists
Breaking into tech shouldn’t feel like a locked door.

As someone who returned to learning later in life, juggled parenting and studies, and tried to launch into the tech world, I saw the same barriers again and again:

Entry-level jobs asking for years of experience.
Unpaid internships being one of the only ways in (despite being illegal in many places).
Talented students and grads being reduced to a CV that doesn’t show half of who they are.

**I didn’t just want to talk about it — I wanted to build something that shows what’s possible.**

## What is InternXchange?

**InternXchange** is a small web app built to spark a bigger idea:

A space where early talent can **share what they know**, **ask for what they need**, and **connect with peers to grow together.**

This isn’t a job board. It’s a bridge.

## What It Does
-  Lets users add what they can **offer** and what they want to **learn**
-  Displays a **live skill swap board** so peers can find each other
-  (Coming soon) Search and filter functionality to find relevant swaps
-  (Future goal) Matching students/grads with **employers who care about more than a CV**

## Who It's For
-  Students & grads struggling to get that “first break”
-  Employers who want fresh, diverse talent — but need help connecting
-  Anyone who believes in fairer, more human routes into tech

## Why It Matters
This is more than a coding project....it’s a **statement**.
A proof-of-concept to show:
- What happens when people build *with* others in mind
- That talent doesn’t always look like a polished CV
- That sometimes, the best way to get experience is to create it

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Still to Come
- Tagging + filtering
- Profile cards with richer info
- Save/share swap entries
- Employer view and intern matchmaking

## Get Involved
Whether you're early in your career, an employer, or just someone who believes in doing things differently — I’d love feedback, ideas, and collaborators.

Let’s build the bridge instead of waiting for the gate to open.
